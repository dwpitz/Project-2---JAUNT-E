# JAUNT-E
A Collection Of Short Excursions and Journeys of Pleasure

##User Stories
* Jaunter lands on login page, sees a background and options that'll open up upon logging in.
* Jaunter enters username and password, (encrypted on server) and is able to enter the site.
* Upon login, user is brought to index of most recently uploaded jaunts and featured maps.  They might see a walking tour of the The Great Fire and visit the O'Leary Cow site. Or, seasonally, they might visit Devil In The White City jaunt or a halloween ghost-tour jaunt.  Other types of walks: A lakefront jaunt? The ultimate Wrigleyville bar call, etc etc. 
* Jaunter has the option to select one of the jaunts, where they are taken to the jaunt show page, or they can visit their own jaunts and edit/upload their own SICK walking paths.
* User goes to profile page where they can choose jaunts they're currently editing, upload new jaunts or edit their profile. The uploaded/completed jaunts are available to anyone logged into the site at the index page/landing page. User can also save other users maps they especially like in their favorite folder. The profile is at LEAST username and how many jaunts they've created and shared.
User decides to upload a new jaunt and visits a page. Here they enter a picture from the jaunt, a link to the map on Google/Bing/OpenStreetMap/AppleMap, a title and a writeup meant to express why they love it and want to share it, maybe some other images from the walk they want to share and descriptions of the points of interest. They choose to save it in their edits folder or to publish to the index that will show it to the community of Jaunty jaunters.
User wants some inspiration and decides to visit someone else's created jaunt. They load the page by going to the index and clicking an image or title from the loaded list. Page loads. At top is a title, followed by the author of the jaunt. Below is rendering of the map (load from various API's?), with a side-bar showing up to five points of the interest with little pics and descriptions if the author chose to make them.
Stretch Goals:
Making points of interest available as their own models (like articles to an author) and searchable out of context.
Message boards or personal messaging.
